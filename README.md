# Kippo

Kippo is a medium interaction SSH honeypot designed to log brute force attacks and, most importantly, the entire shell interaction performed by the attacker.

Kippo is inspired, but not based on [Kojoney](http://kojoney.sourceforge.net/).

## Features

Some interesting features:
* Fake filesystem with the ability to add/remove files. A full fake filesystem resembling a Debian 5.0 installation is included
* Possibility of adding fake file contents so the attacker can 'cat' files such as /etc/passwd. Only minimal file contents are included
* Session logs stored in an [UML Compatible](http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/)  format for easy replay with original timings
* Kippo saves files downloaded with wget or uploaded with SFTP for later inspection

## Requirements

Software required:

* An operating system (tested on Debian, CentOS, FreeBSD and Windows 7)
* Python 2.5+
* Twisted 8.0+
* PyCrypto
* pyasn1
* Zope Interface

See Wiki for some installation instructions.

## How to run it?

Edit kippo.cfg to your liking and start the honeypot by running:

`./start.sh`

start.sh is a simple shell script that runs Kippo in the background using twistd. Detailed startup options can be given by running twistd manually. For example, to run Kippo in foreground:

`twistd -y kippo.tac -n`

By default Kippo listens for ssh connections on port 2222. You can change this, but do not change it to 22 as it requires root privileges. Use port forwarding instead. (More info: [MakingKippoReachable](https://github.com/desaster/kippo/wiki/Making-Kippo-Reachable)).

Files of interest:

* dl/ - files downloaded with wget are stored here
* log/kippo.log - log/debug output
* log/tty/ - session logs
* utils/playlog.py - utility to replay session logs
* utils/createfs.py - used to create fs.pickle
* fs.pickle - fake filesystem
* honeyfs/ - file contents for the fake filesystem - feel free to copy a real system here

## Is it secure?

Maybe. See [FAQ](https://github.com/desaster/kippo/wiki/FAQ)
